## Features
- **Subtitle Processing:** Extracts and cleans text from a subtitle database.
- **Data Chunking:** Splits subtitles into meaningful semantic chunks.
- **Text Embeddings:** Uses Sentence Transformers to convert text into vector representations.
- **Vector Database (ChromaDB):** Stores embeddings for fast similarity search.
- **Semantic Search:** Finds relevant subtitles using Cosine Similarity.

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, Regex â†’ Text Processing
- Sentence Transformers â†’ Embeddings
- ChromaDB â†’ Vector Storage
- SQLite â†’ Subtitle Database
